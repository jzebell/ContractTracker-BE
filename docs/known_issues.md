## ðŸ”´ Critical Issues (Blocking Progress)

### CI-001: Dashboard Data Validation Needed
**Discovered:** Session 6  
**Impact:** Dashboard may show incorrect or missing data  
**Severity:** High - affects primary user workflow  

**Description:** Financial dashboard implementation complete but data flow needs verification. Calculations may be incorrect due to:
- Resource.BurdenedCost potentially returning 0
- LCAT rate assignments not loading properly  
- Date range calculations in projections
- Empty data scenarios not handled gracefully

**Symptoms:**
- Dashboard cards showing $0 or empty values
- Charts not rendering or showing no data
- Console errors in browser developer tools
- API returning successful responses but empty data sets

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Test with known good data (create LCATs â†’ Resources â†’ Contracts â†’ Assignments)
2. Add console logging to trace data through calculation pipeline
3. Verify DashboardAnalyticsService calculations manually
4. Add error boundaries and loading states to React components

**Workaround:** Use API debug panel to verify data existence before dashboard testing

### CI-002: Missing Test Data for Dashboard
**Discovered:** Session 6  
**Impact:** Cannot properly demonstrate dashboard functionality  
**Severity:** Medium - affects stakeholder demos  

**Description:** System has entities and relationships but insufficient test data to showcase dashboard analytics meaningfully.

**Required Test Data:**
- 3-5 LCATs with realistic rates ($50-150/hour range)
- 8-12 Resources assigned to various LCATs
- 4-6 Contracts with different funding levels and types
- Resource assignments across contracts with realistic allocation percentages

**Actions Required:**
1. Create data generation script or manual data entry process
2. Verify all relationships are properly established
3. Test edge cases (over-allocated resources, underwater margins, critical funding)

## ðŸŸ¡ Important Issues (Should Address Soon)

### II-001: Performance Monitoring Missing
**Discovered:** Session 5  
**Impact:** Cannot identify performance bottlenecks  
**Severity:** Medium - affects user experience optimization  

**Description:** No systematic performance monitoring in place. Dashboard load times unknown, database query performance unmeasured.

**Missing Capabilities:**
- API response time measurement
- Database query execution time logging
- Frontend rendering performance tracking
- Memory usage monitoring

**Planned Resolution:** Add performance monitoring in next development phase

**Workaround:** Manual timing of operations using browser developer tools

### II-002: Error Handling Inconsistent
**Discovered:** Session 5  
**Impact:** Poor user experience when errors occur  
**Severity:** Medium - affects user experience and debugging  

**Description:** Error handling varies across components. Some areas have comprehensive error boundaries, others fail silently or show technical error messages.

**Specific Issues:**
- API errors not always translated to user-friendly messages
- Network errors can cause UI to freeze or show blank screens
- Database constraint violations shown as technical error messages
- No centralized error logging or user notification system

**Planned Resolution:** Implement comprehensive error handling strategy

**Workaround:** Check browser console for technical error details when UI behavior unexpected

### II-003: TypeScript 'any' Type Usage
**Discovered:** Session 5  
**Impact:** Reduced type safety and development experience  
**Severity:** Low - affects code quality and maintainability  

**Description:** Some components use 'any' type instead of proper TypeScript definitions, reducing type safety benefits.

**Locations:**
- Dashboard component state management
- API response handling in some services
- Event handlers in form components

**Planned Resolution:** Replace 'any' types with proper interfaces during code quality improvement phase

**Workaround:** Extra runtime validation in components using 'any' types

## ðŸŸ¢ Minor Issues (Enhancement Opportunities)

### MI-001: Mobile Responsiveness Limited
**Discovered:** Session 5  
**Impact:** Dashboard not optimized for mobile/tablet viewing  
**Severity:** Low - affects accessibility but not core functionality  

**Description:** Dashboard designed for desktop viewing. Charts and tables may not display optimally on smaller screens.

**Specific Issues:**
- Chart legends may overlap on narrow screens
- Table horizontal scrolling needed for many columns
- Touch interactions not optimized for charts
- Font sizes may be too small on mobile devices

**Planned Resolution:** Responsive design improvements in UI enhancement phase

**Workaround:** Use desktop or tablet in landscape mode for optimal experience

### MI-002: No Keyboard Navigation
**Discovered:** Session 2  
**Impact:** Accessibility concern for keyboard-only users  
**Severity:** Low - affects accessibility compliance  

**Description:** Custom form components lack comprehensive keyboard navigation support.

**Missing Features:**
- Tab navigation through inline editing fields
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (Save All, Cancel)
- Enter key handling in form fields
- Escape key to cancel editing mode

**Planned Resolution:** Accessibility improvements in UI enhancement phase

**Workaround:** Use mouse/touch for navigation and form interaction

## ðŸ”§ Resolved Issues

### RI-001: Entity Property Mismatches (Session 5)
**Discovered:** Session 5  
**Resolved:** Session 5  
**Issue:** Controllers referenced non-existent entity properties causing 89+ compilation errors

**Resolution:** Complete entity and controller refactoring:
- Fixed all property name mismatches (CreatedAt vs CreatedDate, etc.)
- Added missing properties (Resource.BurdenedCost)
- Created comprehensive DTO structure
- Updated all Entity Framework configurations

**Outcome:** Clean compilation, proper entity structure, maintainable codebase

### RI-002: CORS Configuration Issues (Session 2)  
**Discovered:** Session 2  
**Resolved:** Session 2  
**Issue:** Frontend unable to connect to backend API due to CORS policy

**Resolution:** 
- Added CORS configuration in Program.cs
- Ensured CORS middleware ordered before authorization
- Configured to allow all origins for development

**Outcome:** Successful API connectivity, frontend-backend integration working

### RI-003: Database Migration Conflicts (Session 1)
**Discovered:** Session 1  
**Resolved:** Session 1  
**Issue:** Entity Framework migrations failing due to schema conflicts

**Resolution:**
- Reset migration history
- Recreated initial migration with correct schema
- Established proper migration workflow

**Outcome:** Stable database schema, reliable migration process

## ðŸš¨ Technical Debt

### TD-001: No Automated Testing
**Category:** Quality Assurance  
**Priority:** High (for production)  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks

**Description:** No unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests implemented. All testing currently manual.

**Risks:**
- Regression bugs during refactoring
- Difficult to validate business logic changes
- Slower development velocity for complex changes
- Reduced confidence in releases

**Resolution Plan:**
- Unit tests for domain entities and business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- Test data factories for consistent test scenarios

### TD-002: Hardcoded Configuration Values
**Category:** Configuration Management  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** 1 week

**Description:** Some configuration values embedded in code rather than externalized.

**Examples:**
- Wrap rate multipliers (2.28, 1.15) in business logic
- API timeouts and connection strings in some components
- Chart colors and styling in component code

**Resolution Plan:**
- Configuration service for business rules
- Environment-specific configuration files
- Admin interface for configurable business rules

### TD-003: Limited Logging and Monitoring
**Category:** Observability  
**Priority:** High (for production)  
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks

**Description:** Minimal logging and no structured monitoring in place.

**Missing Capabilities:**
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracking and alerting
- User activity monitoring

**Resolution Plan:**
- Implement structured logging (Serilog)
- Add application performance monitoring
- Create operational dashboards
- Establish alerting for critical errors
