## Project Overview
**Name:** Contract Tracker  
**Purpose:** Federal contract resource management system for tracking personnel, LCATs, rates, and profitability  
**Stage:** MVP Development - Financial Dashboard Complete  
**Started:** January 2025  

## Business Context
### Problem Statement
As a Program Manager on federal government contracts, managing personnel and financials across multiple contracts requires tracking numerous moving parts: labor categories (LCATs), billing rates, resource assignments, and wrap rates. Currently, this information is scattered across spreadsheets, emails, and various systems, making it difficult to:
- Quickly assess team composition and costs
- Make informed staffing decisions
- Track rate changes over time
- Calculate actual vs. projected costs with wrap rates
- Ensure compliance with contract requirements

### Key Stakeholders
- **Primary Users:** Program Managers responsible for federal contract staffing and financials
- **Secondary Users:** 
  - Finance teams needing cost/revenue reports
  - HR teams coordinating hiring/onboarding
  - Proposal teams needing historical rate data
- **Admin Users:** System administrators managing access and data integrity

### Core Business Value
1. **Centralized Information Hub:** Single source of truth for all contract personnel and rates
2. **Financial Visibility:** Real-time understanding of team costs including wrap rates
3. **Improved Decision Making:** Quick access to data for staffing and negotiation decisions
4. **Compliance Tracking:** Ensure resources meet contract requirements (clearances, certs, etc.)
5. **Historical Analysis:** Track rate changes and resource allocation over time

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend:** .NET 8 with Clean Architecture
- **Frontend:** React 18 with TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Docker)
- **Charts:** Recharts for data visualization
- **State Management:** React hooks

{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=ContractTracker;Username=postgres;Password=yourpassword"
  }
}
```

### Frontend (.env)
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5154
```

### Docker Compose (for PostgreSQL)
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: ContractTracker
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: yourpassword
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
```

## Development Workflow

### Local Development Commands
```bash
# Backend
cd contract-tracker-backend
dotnet restore
dotnet ef database update --project ContractTracker.Infrastructure --startup-project ContractTracker.Api
dotnet run --project ContractTracker.Api

# Frontend
cd contract-tracker-frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Git Strategy
- **Separate Repositories:**
  - `contract-tracker-backend` (.NET API)
  - `contract-tracker-frontend` (React/TypeScript)
- **Main Branch:** `main` (production-ready)
- **Development Branch:** `develop`
- **Feature Branches:** `feature/[ticket-number]-description`
- **Commit Convention:** Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)

## Session 6 Priorities

### Option 1: Debug and Complete Dashboard
1. Ensure data flows properly
2. Fix calculation issues
3. Add error boundaries
4. Seed test data

### Option 2: Export/Reporting Features
1. Excel export functionality
2. PDF report generation
3. CSV data downloads
4. Report templates

### Option 3: Advanced Analytics
1. Trending analysis
2. Predictive forecasting
3. Anomaly detection
4. Natural language insights

### Option 4: Timesheet Integration
1. Actual hours tracking
2. Real burn rate calculations
3. Variance analysis
4. Time entry UI

## AI/ML/RPA Opportunities Identified

### Implemented/Started
1. **Dashboard Analytics:** Complex calculations and projections (Session 5)
2. **Burn Rate Predictions:** Foundation laid with projection system

### Short-term Opportunities
1. **Smart LCAT Matching:** ML to suggest best LCAT based on position title
2. **Rate Prediction:** Predict optimal pay rates based on historical data
3. **Anomaly Detection:** Flag unusual burn rates or margins
4. **Natural Language Queries:** "Show me all underwater resources"

### Long-term Opportunities
1. **Resource Demand Forecasting:** Predict future staffing needs
2. **Automated Compliance Checking:** RPA for clearance verification
3. **Intelligent Resource Allocation:** AI-optimized staff assignments
4. **Predictive Risk Scoring:** Identify at-risk contracts early

## Testing Strategy [TO BE IMPLEMENTED]

### Unit Tests (70%)
- Domain logic tests
- Service layer tests
- Component tests

### Integration Tests (20%)
- API endpoint tests
- Database integration tests
- External service tests

### E2E Tests (10%)
- Critical user journeys
- Cross-browser testing

## Notes & Decisions Log
- **2025-01-10 Session 1:** Initial project structure with Clean Architecture
- **2025-01-10 Session 2:** Frontend implementation, fixed API integration
- **2025-01-10 Session 3:** Complete Contract Management with funding tracking
- **2025-01-XX Session 4:** Resource assignments and real burn calculations
- **2025-01-XX Session 5:** Financial Dashboard and major refactoring
- **Decision:** Defer auth to later phase, use "System" as placeholder user
- **Decision:** Implement burn rate calculations with actual resource data
- **Decision:** Use visual indicators (emojis/colors) for funding warnings
- **Decision:** Use Recharts for dashboard visualizations
- **Decision:** Service layer for complex analytics calculations
